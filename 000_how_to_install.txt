Just i need to go to dependencies folder and then install all the things, using,

	sudo dpkg -i *.deb

This is not only OBS But Also VLC Player (OBS: 30.0.2.1-3build1 (64 bit); VLC:3.0.20 Vetenari)



This is the place to install OBS Studio from the APT offline, first i did download the dependencies in my folder by this process below:

sudo apt-get install --print-uris --yes obs-studio | grep ^\' | cut -d\' -f2 > obs-packages.txt
mkdir dependencies
cd dependencies
wget -i ../obs-packages.txt
